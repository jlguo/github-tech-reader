# AGENTS.md — github-tech-reader-v2

High-level rules, principles, and practices for working in this repo.
**For all implementation detail (architecture, data layer, security internals,
Android build, API tables, categories, flows), see [`README.md`](./README.md)** — each
rule below links to the relevant section.

> **Project**: 电子书架 (Cloud Shelf) — a web app for organizing and reading tech content

## Hard Rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Ports are fixed** — Frontend Vite `5173`, Backend FastAPI `8000`. Never change them
   in config, CLI args, or env vars. CORS and the frontend client are hard-coded to these.
   See [README → 快速开始](./README.md#快速开始--quick-start).

2. **Verify frontend changes with Playwright** — After ANY frontend change that affects UI
   behavior, data flow, or API integration, run Playwright to verify. Never ship without
   Playwright confirmation. This is the project's primary verification mechanism.
   - **Scoped verification for small changes**: For a **small change** (a single bug fix or
     a specific, self-contained enhancement), **do NOT run the full e2e suite**. Instead,
     write (or reuse) **one specific e2e spec that covers exactly that change**, run only
     that spec, and confirm it passes. The full suite is reserved for broad/cross-cutting
     changes (shared state, data layer, routing, multi-reader, or anything touching several
     features). See [README → E2E Tests](./README.md#e2e-tests--playwright).

3. **Delegate proactively** — Do not implement, explore, or research alone when a
   specialized sub-agent can do it. Decompose first, dispatch in parallel
   (`run_in_background=true`) when units have no shared state. See **Delegation** below.

4. **Never weaken type safety or swallow errors** — No `as any`, `@ts-ignore`,
   `@ts-expect-error`, or empty `catch {}`. Never delete failing tests to make a suite pass.

5. **Never commit unless explicitly requested.**

## Delegation — HARD RULE

> ALWAYS delegate work to sub-agents proactively. This is non-negotiable.

- **Decompose first**: break any non-trivial task into independent units; run them in
  parallel when there is no shared state or sequential dependency.
- **Match the agent to the work**:
  - codebase search / pattern discovery → `explore`
  - external libs, docs, OSS examples → `librarian`
  - hard architecture / debugging / review → `oracle`
  - frontend / UI / styling → `visual-engineering` category
  - hard logic / algorithms → `ultrabrain` category
  - autonomous end-to-end work → `deep` category
- **Always pass `load_skills`**: evaluate available skills before every dispatch; load the
  relevant ones (`[]` only when none match).
- **Never duplicate delegated work**: once a sub-agent is working, do not redo the same
  search yourself — wait for results, then verify them.
- **Verify after delegation**: confirm the deliverable works, follows existing patterns, and
  met the stated MUST DO / MUST NOT DO constraints before marking complete.
- **Git worktrees for new sessions / topics**: when a distinct new topic could run in
  parallel with in-progress work, consider an isolated git worktree (and branch). Case-by-
  case judgment, not a requirement; skip for small self-contained edits. **Always get
  explicit human approval before creating a worktree.**

## Practices

### Testing
- Simulate human UI interactions. Do not use API mocking (`page.route`) or `page.goto` to
  bypass the UI — interact through the page like a real user.
- Do not add/increase `waitForTimeout` without justification. When a test hangs, add
  `console.log` debug to find the exact stuck step before touching any timeout.
- New features get Playwright tests covering happy path, edge cases, and error states.
- For visual verification, use `console.log` + `innerText()` — do not rely on screenshots
  alone. Full practices: [README → Smoke Test Practices](./README.md#smoke-test-practices).

### Security (backend is hardened — keep it that way)
- The backend enforces SSRF blocking, upload caps, extension whitelist, path-traversal
  guards, SQLite foreign-key cascades, and script-disabled sandboxed file serving. Do not
  regress these. Details: [README → 后端安全加固](./README.md#后端安全加固--backend-security-hardening).
- Untrusted HTML must be DOMPurify-sanitized before rendering. See
  [README → HTML Sanitization](./README.md#html-sanitization).

### Data layer & dual mode
- Consumer code calls `getDataService()` — **never** raw `fetch()`. The same code path must
  work in both remote and local modes. See
  [README → Dual-Mode Architecture](./README.md#dual-mode-architecture).

### Categories
- Membership is computed by **label matching** against a book's `tags`, not a stored
  per-book field. The legacy `book.category` is vestigial — never filter on it. Keep
  import-time tag injection in sync with `SYSTEM_CATEGORIES`. See
  [README → Categories](./README.md#categories--label-based-membership-runtime-managed).

### Reading progress
- `book.progress` is reading progress (0–100), **NOT** generation progress. Never set it
  from `status === "done"`. See [README → Reading Progress](./README.md#reading-progress).

## Conventions

- **pnpm** only for frontend — no npm or yarn.
- Prefer Tailwind classes over inline styles (the Figma export has many inline styles).
- **shadcn/ui** is the UI foundation; avoid adding new UI libraries. MUI lingers in the
  prototype deps and should be removed.
- Chinese content: sort with `localeCompare("zh")`.
- Readers follow the `ReaderModal.tsx` dispatch pattern (one component per document type,
  dispatched by `book.type` / `sourceType`). Untrusted HTML is sanitized and rendered via
  same-origin `srcDoc`; the parent listens for the `reader-center-tap` `postMessage`.
- Backend: async SQLAlchemy with `aiosqlite`; use `selectinload` for eager-loading.
- Environment: copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and configure `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  and the LLM keys. See [README → 配置](./README.md#配置--configuration).
- **SSE**: use the `useBookStatus` hook (SSE primary, 5s polling fallback); open only for
  the selected book (detail modal), not shelf-wide.
- **Imported books** use the `ImportedBook` model; `GET /api/books` unions them with
  repo-generated books via `source_type`.
- **genStatus**: `"pending" | "fetching" | "planning" | "cover" | "writing" | "reviewing" | "publishing" | "done" | "failed" | "no_book"` — all 10 recognized in UI.
